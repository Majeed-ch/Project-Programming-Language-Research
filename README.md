# CST8333-S23-Projects
This repo includes all the projects and assignemnt for the course Programming Language Research CST8333.

## practical project part 1
*due date May 21st 2023.*

- Create a project, in your language of study that meets the following requirements:
  - Create a record object (also known as entity object, data-transfer object) that uses the column names from the dataset as part of the source code, e.g. variable names, accessors/mutators names, or constants.
  - Use File-IO on startup to open and read the dataset, initializing a few record objects with data parsed from the first few records in the csv file. The record objects should be stored in a simple data structure (array or a list), use exception handling in case the file is missing or not available.
  - Loop over the data structure, and output the record data on screen.
  - Displays your full name on screen so it remains visible at all times.
- Take a separate screen shot of your program performing each task above, ensuring your full name is within each screen shot.
- Comment your source code file using documentation comments (docstrings in Python, XML-document in C# or VB.Net, JSDoc for server-side JavaScript etc.)
- Your program should use the following programming concepts: variables, methods, a loop structure, File-IO reading from the dataset, exception handling, use of an API library, an array (or similar data structure).
